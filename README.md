# ZeroDivisionError in Async Node.js Function

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to zero division in asynchronous Node.js functions. The issue arises when the function is called with zero values as arguments, and the error isn't immediately caught. This leads to unexpected behavior and potential application crashes.

## Bug Description

The `myFunction` attempts to handle the case of division by zero, but due to the nature of asynchronous operations in Node.js, this handling might not always work as expected.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node bug.js`
3. Observe the unexpected output or error.

## Solution

The provided solution handles the zero division check more robustly, ensuring that the error is properly caught and handled, regardless of the asynchronous nature of the operation.
